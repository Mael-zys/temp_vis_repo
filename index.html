 - ASR text: what are you gonna show us today we. talked a little bit about Dwyane Wade. and I want to go deeper to the box score. what made them effective last night and. we're gonna marvel at his offensive. exploits and rightfully so but a lot of. times what gets lost is the preparation. okay right now Dwyane Wade is paying. attention to the play they're gonna run. and you see Ben Simmons. you know this action he's gonna pop up. he's gonna try to receive the ball Ben. Simmons want to try to feed them but the. problem is the way Wade is watching B's. look Street says watch it sees. everything before you know it he's gonna. dip in he gonna dip out four big six as. I like to call it so check this out. Ben Simmons the passed ball um well you. know what Wade snatcher he's gone the. other way for the easy dunk and that's. what gets a veteran player going. especially at this point of his career. but once you start off seven for seven. you're feeling really good about your. game here right here I love this philsie. see Ben Simmons on him this is amazing. now this is a young bull right here okay. he plays defense he's really creative on. the offensive side of the basketball. obviously and he has youth on his side. and this is a young man's game but watch. it the way Wade does when he see who's. guarding him it's gonna hit amazing he's. like I got this dude watch it whoa I'm. excited I got this I got this isolation. only sees the help right here yeah I'm. gonna go that way aim back bang bang and. this is what I love right here yeah we. do I love that deal hey by the way he. gets left it can't get jiggy with this. that's his man that's his line he's a. comedian oh good shot and we know that. guy Hey look this is the answer we're. talking so much about Kevin Hart Hall of. Famer right here that's a great change. absolutely Juelz and Dwyane Wade just. giving him that desk. he doesn't even break and that's what I. love about playoff basketball every. moment means so much</p>

Paulo, but when I was one year old I joined. them and that's where I practically. started my football career, right? I became a. professional very early,. so we start cheering for. Praia, for the team that has. control over it, right?. So here because they wanted me to be paid, I. cheered for a Linense team, it was from. Portuguesa and then I turned to Palmeiras.. Now today, after so long and. without playing all this time, I left. football at the age of 29 and it's 67. today I can say that I'm a Palmeiras fan.</p>

 - ASR text: hello ladies and gents this time around. will'll be covering the one and only Sun. Wukong Brute Force precision and control. are all attributes that describe the. Monkey King Wukong is also one of the. few gods in Smite with the ability to. LEAP as a melee assassin this gives him. a huge Advantage when it comes to. ganking and initiating and getting out. of trouble his trademark though is his. ultimate having the ability to crowd. control multiple enemies simultaneously. makes Wukong a top competitor amongst. [Music]. assassins Sun wukong's passive is Fleet. footed while out of combat wukong's. movement speed is increased by. 10% wukong's first ability is known as. somersault he will leap and crash down. at his Target location dealing damage. and slowing all nearby enemies I put a. point in this at level two and Max it. last his second ability is overhand. smash Wukong will smash his staff to the. ground in front of him dealing physical. damage to enemies in a cone I grab this. at level one and Max it first Furious. monkey is son wukong's third ability. Wukong will send an image of a monkey in. a straight line that will bounce on up. to four enemies a put Aon in to this at. level three and Max it. second finally wukong's ultimate is. known as year of the monkey. Wukong will send out fireworks that will. explode at a Target location dealing. damage to enemies within it additionally. enemies that are caught by the initial. explosion are feared for 2. seconds with Wukong I like to start out. with rank one Warrior Tabby hand of the. Gods and five healing potions for my. final build I upgrade my boots and then. pick up the devour gloves a deathbringer. magi's blessing a void blade and the. Titan's Bane for abilities I grab. purification beats and Heavenly agility. optional items for Wukong are the. Brawler's beat stick and the frostbound. hammer the way I play son Wukong during. the laning phase is a bit unorthodox but. it works extremely well the reason I. grab hand of gods is because I'll be. taking the Buffs on my side of the map. while still maintaining control of the. lane I start out at Green buff and then. move over to Blue buff if you have a. lane partner doing it together is the. best idea because you'll be able to. clear both camps before the minions even. get to the Lane and you'll both be. leveled two once you're done all you. have to do is play extremely. aggressively making sure you make the. most out of the Buffs and continue. expanding your lead even more make sure. to grab red buff whenever hand of the. guts comes off cool down and you see an. opening also don't be afraid to gank. Middle Lane every so often because of. your passive you'll barely lose any. laning. experience. one of the things that makes Wukong such. a strong God is the ability to initiate. team fights using a combination of. heavenly agility somersault and year of. the monkey is a great way to do so try. to initiate by jumping into the lane. from the jungle if possible once your. ultimate is used your role is to find. the enemy carries and burst them down. another option is to Simply never team. fight having a leap and increased. movement speed buff an extremely strong. 1 V one potential and hand of the Gods. makes Wukong one of the best Gods to. back door with if you can manage to get. your team to stall the enemy team while. you constantly push Lanes you'll end up. grabbing a phoenix before you even know. it also forcing enemies to chase after. you opens the door for your team to take. crucial objectives like fire Giant and. gold Fury without a problem in other. words you can be a really annoying. monkey. good laning partners for Wukong include. anyone with a leap because of how. aggressively we'll be playing during the. laning phase characters like bed. Bakasura and Odin will be able to. simultaneously jump on your enemies with. you and make the most out of your slow. effect too many people underestimate the. burst potential of leap abilities early. game take advantage of. this number one Leap is King most people. don't know this but in Smite you can use. your leap for multiple different things. you can simply leap to initiate a. retreat from a fight but you can also. leap through walls allowing for even. greater mobility and finally you can. avoid almost everything by simply. leaping at the right time you can. completely mitigate spells like soix and. yamir's ultimates by using summersa. right before they go. off number two Take the Lead this tip. applies especially for when you're. playing solo que don't be afraid to take. the horns and lead your team to Victory. what I mean by this is that you. shouldn't wait for the enemy team to. initiate on yours especially when you. have any form of Advantage Wukong is way. too strong of an initiator for you to. just sit around and wait for things to. happen number three clear efficiently. the reason I decided to include this one. is because I see way too many people. using cone abilities incorrectly when. clearing minions if you simply move to. the side of the minion your cone ability. will be able to hit all of them instead. of just one group this will allow you to. clear faster and Save. Mana number four aim your ultimate this. one seems kind of obvious but I don't. mean it that way you should always try. to hit as many targets because of the. fear effect but if you're fighting a 1 V. one try to make it so that the center of. the ultimate lands right on top of the. enemy the fear effect only lasts for 2. seconds but the damage part of the spell. lasts for five if you want to maximize. your damage output this is one of the. things you'll need to. do finally number five preempt prve. beats another thing you should do if. you're trying to maximize your. efficiency is using purification beats. preemptively in case you didn't know. purification beats not only cleanses any. crack control effects on you it also. makes you immune to them for 2 seconds. upon activation for instance if you're. fighting guo 1 V one and he's about to. hit you with the third strike of his. ultimate use the Beats right before it. hits you instead of afterwards this way. you'll be able to continue attacking him. without any interruptions. whatsoever. as always thanks everyone for watching. and I hope you enjoyed the video don't. forget to follow us on Twitter and.

Saturday um I thought we were the much. better team and for the majority of the. game um orbe it a goal I mean couple of. couple of posts and a couple of half. chances some balls whipped across the. box come quite on the end of but um yeah. positive positive feedback from that. yeah looking forward Boxing Day at. Bramble Lane that's obviously not good. memories for you this this year. obviously gives you a chance to uh to to. blank that out a little bit and and come. up with a goal or two hopefully yeah. yeah well it's good memories in terms. that I've scored um obviously then after. um but that's um all behind now I feel. good um going into the games I'm not. even thinking about that now um so it'd. be lovely to cap it off a year to the. day on uh with a goal yeah.

 - ASR text: praise be to Jesus u.s. Catholic priests. ordaining women permanent deacons will. enhance pastoral ministry to God's. people in this National Assembly held in. Seattle in June 2013 the Association of. United States Catholic priests passed. the resolution to promote the ongoing. discussion of the ordination of women as. permanent deacons and agreed to ask the. u.s. bishops to give public support to. the restoration of the first millennium. practice of ordaining women as permanent. deacons developments in recent weeks. give new impetus to that request in May. Pro Pope Francis announced plans to. create a commission to study the. possibility of allowing women to serve. as deacons the fact that the matter is. open for discussion is seen as a signal. of historic openness regarding church. practice of an all-male clergy in August. the Vatican announced that after intense. prayer and mature reflection Pope. Francis has established a commission of. study on the died continent of women and. named twelve members to it six women six. men including one American professor. Philip Phyllis sagano. who teaches at Hofstra University have. said New York the Archbishop of Santa Fe. is hosting the association of u.s.. Catholic priests is hosting a conference. in Albuquerque New Mexico this month. among the topics of conversation will be. the ordination of women deaconesses. which of course will evolve into women. priests their mission Us tab. like priests ordaining women permanent. deacons will enhance pastoral ministry. to God's people. now this last paragraph here comes from. a Facebook page on my post which led me. to the website and on the website it's. the first part of what I was telling you. about I had never heard of this group of. obviously very liberal Catholic priests. you can read more at the link and you. know you can take a look at the. description of how they identify. themselves but the first part of the. article has to do because it says August. so that has to do with 2013 but this. meeting in Albuquerque is coming up. shortly here so that's that's what the. post on my Facebook page is about</p>

 - ASR text: hey guys what's up it's Charlie here and. today we're going to be looking at 10. things you should never do on an. airplane Air Travel can be stressful. we've all seen people who have no regard. for others ruin everybody else's trip in. this video we're going to be looking at. some of the worst things people have. done on planes shocking confessions of. how nasty airplanes are by pilots and. crew members and some other things you. probably do but shouldn't on airplanes. before this video starts click the link. in the top right corner to sub subscribe. to little things for more amazing. content and subscribe to top 10s and. turn on notifications and comment done. when you've done this for a shout out at. the end of our next. video coming in at number 10 we have. ordering water water is healthy and. would likely be welcomed on a hot dry. plane right well surprisingly not at all. ask any flight attendant and they will. always tell you to avoid drinking water. on board the reason why is because it is. disgusting airplane water is often not. very hygienic and traces salmonella and. insect EGS have been found in the water. before and one inate planes actually. fail to meet hygiene requirements when. it comes to their water that's 15% of. all planes having potentially harmful. water thanks to bacteria the reason why. it's so nasty is because the water. passes through many different stages. before getting onto the plane and it. always ends up in the pl's water storage. tank which is often not cleaned out. enough and if you're thinking well. that's fine I'll just have a coffee or. tea instead then think again Airline. employees also avoid these because. they're made made of the same. contaminated water and even though it is. hot water it may not be heated up enough. to get rid of all the bacteria some. Airlines even use this water as a. substitute for bottled water if they run. out so remember to always buy a bottle. of water at the airport before getting. on a plane and it might just save you. from being sick on. vacation next up is Barefoot you. wouldn't see someone getting onto a bus. or train with bare feet but for some. reason people think it's totally. acceptable on airplanes sure it's nice. to feel at home on an airplane you're. going to be stuck on for hours but it's. not always nice for you or others to be. barefoot first off flight attendants. will tell you that airplane floors are. much dirtier than they seem dirt and. food can get embedded in the carpet. floor which is not often thoroughly. cleaned and the bathroom floor is. obviously not the cleanest some. passengers even press the inflight. buttons with their feet not to mention. some people's feet smell and you don't. want to expose everybody else on the. airplane to that it's not uncommon for. passengers to put their feet up or put. them in between two seats which of. course is intrusive rude and gross so. keep your shoes on for you and everyone. else on the plane it will prevent germs. getting into you and ensure that all of. the other passengers are in a non-. stinky. environment next up is reclining your. seat we've all been there you're bummed. out about the lack of leg room in your. airplane seat and then the guy in front. of you reclines his seat all the way. back reducing it even more that's right. just because it's there the recline. button should not be used if there's. someone sitting behind you this can be. even worse if the person behind you has. a drink on their tray as it could spill. if you choose to recline back nobody. wants to have you pretty much lying on. top of them so don't recline back it's. rude instead ask the person behind you. if they mind you reclining and if they. say no then don't you may be cramped up. in the plane but so is everybody else. some passionate Flyers have even created. petitions to try and ban people from. reclining their seats on airplanes but. this is something that many are very. divided about so what do you think about. this do you think reclining seats should. be banned allog together or is it. acceptable if you ask. first next up is messing with your seat. belt the importance and effectiveness of. airplane seat belts is often debated but. you shouldn't mess with your seat belt. too much this is not for safety reasons. however but for Hygiene reasons The. Today Show found that seat belts are. pretty nasty and in some cases seat. belts are dirtier than airplane toilets. this is because they're not always. cleaned as well as more visible things. such as tray tables and the seats many. people like to fiddle with the. flickering mechanism on seat belts but. really it's pretty gross and seat belts. are usually covered in harmful bacteria. the actual seat belt is also very hard. to clean as it's made of fabric and can. get anything from sticky drinks to baby. saliva on it often pieces of gum can. also be stuck to seat belts too now that. is something I've actually seen myself. many Airline employees actually suggest. taking some sanitizing liquid on board. with you and using it after you fastened. your seat belt and when that no seat. belt needed light flashes up be sure to. get that thing off you ASAP and when you. do don't forget to sanitize. again next up is drinking when it comes. to airplanes drinking on them is a. popular thing to do it can be nice to. unwind as you ascend into the air and. there's no limits as to how much you can. have but it's important to know if you. should drink or not and if you do how. much you should have some people get. overly excited about their vacation and. go way overboard it may sound like fun. in games but it can have some pretty bad. consequences if you fall asleep after. drinking on a plane you may wake up hung. over and it will mess with your quality. of sleep there may also be turbulence. which can make it hard for your stomach. to process the drink some have even. vomited or got into heated arguments and. were rude to Star thanks to drinking way. too much on the plane so it's always. best to wait until you land before you. start boozing it up I'm sure there'll be. plenty of bars wherever you're. going next up we have rude to cabin crew. it's not nice to be rude to anyone but. it's especially bad when they're trying. to serve you and do a job but some. people just don't seem to appreciate. this people's bad behavior have got. kicked off airplanes before and rightly. so and former flight attendants have. admitted it's often worse with people in. first and business class in one case. somebody bought a burger from the. outside onto the plane and demanded they. heat it up flight attendants are not. allowed to do this but it caused a huge. argument flight attendants are just. following the rules set by their company. something you probably also do at work. some passengers have been so rude to. cabin crew they've ended up being banned. from some Airlines you can't treat staff. badly regardless of whether you're in. regular or business business class and. no one working a job should have to deal. with rude customers so be sure to be. super nice to any flight attendants it. might just make their day and as a. result they will make your flight more. pleasant do you think rude passengers. should be banned from Airlines or is. that too. harsh next up is loud music when out in. public some new social rules apply but. unfortunately it seems some people don't. realize they've left their bedroom and. have stepped onto an airplane we all. know it's annoying when someone at the. library or in class is blasting loud. music from their headphones or speakers. that's annoying as it is but how about. this happening for hours on an airplane. that's right many people have witnessed. people blasting music out of headphones. which don't really block the sound this. is super rude and annoying for everybody. else on board but there's a tip that can. help you never do this modern cell. phones now show the volume bar as red. when your music gets too loud and this. isn't just out of the respect for those. around you but also for your own health. this is because the red volume bar means. the music is too loud for your ears so. turn that music down and make the fly. experience better for you and everybody. else next up is sleep times when flying. on a long flight it can be tempting to. dose off this is fine but it's important. when you choose to sleep make sure you. sleep at a time that will make sense for. the new time zone you're going into. otherwise you could wake up feeling. refreshed at 2: a.m. when you should be. tired then this can also lead to extreme. jet lag and cause you to get out of the. loop with the time zone you're in the. best thing to do is to set your watch to. your new time zone as soon as you get on. the airplane that way you can make the. adjustment as soon as possible you. should also not sleep during takeoff or. Landing this is because during takeoff. and Landing the pressure around you. changes faster than the air inside your. ears and if you've ever flown before you. know this can be very uncomfortable so. to stop this happening don't sleep. during the plane's Ascent or descent and. as a little life hack if your ears get. all pressurized even when you're not. sleeping chew gum or a candy to equalize. the air pressure next up is eating food. of tray tables we all flight many. different times and because of this many. people eat breakfast lunch or dinner on. board their flights it may seem natural. to eat food off the airplane tray tables. that's what they're for right well yes. but any flight attendant would cringe if. they saw you doing this that is because. they know the plan's trade tables are. often not cleaned thoroughly in a. Today's Show study they found the. highest levels of harmful bacteria on. tray tables that's right it would be. cleaner to eat up a toilet seat than an. airplane tray table and in some cases. flight attendants have caught moms using. the trays to change their baby's diapers. yeah maybe I'll just put that sandwich. on my lap rather than on my tray table. next time Excuse me while I throw up. real. quick next up is arguing some people can. get pretty Rowdy when they fly either. with fellow passengers or a flight. attendant it seems a new viral video of. an airplane freakout emerges every week. these can be arguments among passengers. or in some cases the plane is overbooked. and a flight attendant has to kick a. passenger off the arguments often begin. with a lot of shouting but can turn. physical this goes without saying but. you should never put you or anyone else. you're flying with in danger thankfully. these are somewhat rare in fact the cash. me outside girl is actually banned from. an airline for this reason looks like. somebody really did cash her outside and. other people who do this usually get. kicked off the flight and sometimes even. arrested so sit back relax and watch. some top 10s videos instead of arguing. on a. flight check out the poll in the top. right corner and you can vote for the. most surprising thing you should never. do on an airplane I think it's drinking. the water because that is really nice NY. and I'm going to make sure I buy a. bottle next time I fly but as always. thanks for watching check out some more. videos on screen right now leave a like. if you enjoyed and if you haven't. already what are you waiting for. subscribe to top 10.

Orrville Ohio so pretty cool little. tractor first thing we got to do is fix. a tire that went down and it was. constantly going down it came off the. rim I took it up to the tire store they. put a slimed tube in it so hopefully we. won't have any more problems this is the. landscape rake on the front of the. ventrac and this is Ricky Bobby the. landscape brake on the rear of the. ventrac so we're going to be dueling. rakes here dueling landscape rakes today. we have an area probably about I don't. say 1/2 acre maybe 3/4 of an acre up on. the top side of our farm here that we. just cleaned off you're gonna see a lot. of rocks here there are a ton of rocks. in this area it's a hedgerow where for I. guess the last several hundred years the. farmers attended this property piled up. all the rocks well we came in and. disturbed that pile and opened up a time. bomb basically of rocks so what we're. planning on doing is getting up here. with Reiki bobby and reiki bobby is good. for loosening everything up and then the. rake on the front of the honey badger or. the ventrac there the rake on the front. of that is good for pushing up piles and. after we get done we'll take the skid. loader and we'll go scoop up all those. rocks and we'll dump them off in the. woods and a place that we know won't be. pasture anymore just so you guys know if. you haven't been to the farm what we. have here on this farm is around 200. acres and everything you see here I'm. gonna walk over here real quick. everything you see here was not here. five years ago so we put the shopman we. put the driveway in these are our baby. birds and our mobile chicken tractor. right here and our cows are over there. all of this was forested and we're. taking it back to pasture and we're a. first generation farm so let's get busy. we're gonna crank up the ventrac raise. up the rake in the front and put that. wheel and tire back on. okay here's the wheel and tire assembly. and basically we just put another tube. in there. this wheel entire assembly comes out it. has bushing I guess in there that it. spins upon and this is a greasable setup. so what we'll do we'll slide our bushing. inside the wheel here kind of show you. guys what I'm doing. slide that bushing inside the wheel. that's our grease fitting right there. right here and this front piece right. here on the ventrac this these wheels. are set up to make sure that you level. land so you can rake debris off the land. this is hard to do and talk at the same. time there we go so you can rake debris. off the land and you can level land or. gravel so this is an awesome little. driveway maintenance machine we leased. the ventrac tractor last year and we. decided to go on and buy the tractor. after our lease was up this year so. we've had the tractor for somewhere in. the neighborhood of a year and we own it. now if that's not a testament to how. awesome these little tractors are I. don't know what is we mowed 85 acres of. pasture with this machine somewhere in a. neighborhood of five to seven times last. year so five to seven times we mowed our. pastures with this machine with the. rough cut deck we have this landscape. break we have a rough cut deck we have a. finished cut deck with a striper on it. and we also have a stump grinder for. this machine and you'll see more of that. as the videos progressed throughout the. year this year let's hop on get busy. we're going to ride up here you're going. to get some cool drone footage and all. kinds of stuff we'll take you up kind of. show you the debris field real quick. here we are on the rock ridge so I'll. post a link at the end of this video to. when I clean this off with the excavator. and then we had my loader crew come in. behind us and you can see where the. grass is brown versus where its light. brown or green this is the area with all. the dirt and rocks and debris got pushed. all the way down into the woods over. here so down off over the hill what my. goal is is to get all these rocks up so. here's an example all throughout here. this land is covered with rocks we can. pick them up by hand but man what a. chore so the goal with the ventrac is to. pull the rocks into a windrow so I'm. trying to pull the rocks all the way up. into a win we're right here with a. window right here kind of hard to say so. the landscape break on the back is. angled this one will also be angled and. when we get done we'll take the rock. piles and push them up with this thing. it's like a mini bulldozer basically as. we start working all these rocks up you. can see lots of rocks lots of stuff to. clean up we're gonna toss the drone up. in the air you'll get an interesting. aerial perspective and you'll really be. able to see where we pushed off over. down the hill I'm gonna program the. drone to kind of follow me as I go. hopefully fingers crossed we don't get. into some trees. [Applause]. alright guys you can see right there the. sun's going down on Appalachia and I got. my best good helper here with me with. big smiles on all the way up here did. you park this right here yeah so guys. you can see we've taken all the rocks. and debris and there's still a few rocks. out here we'll have to handpick some of. these well we're gonna go back and forth. with the rake it's probably gonna take. me another 4 hours tomorrow I've been. out here for about three hours now but. you can see it went from the surface of. the Moon all rough and rocky to smooth. and nice and you can see one of the. piles I pulled it up here on top of this. pile just to park and stuff what we'll. do after this is we'll come in and we'll. spread some seed so this little. landscape rake and little Reiki Bobby on. the back there makes an awesome seed bed. so I'll come up here and I'll spread. some grass seed down some fescue and. some annual rye grass and a little bit. of millet millet takes better in the dry. time of year it's the wet time of year. now but it's going to be in the dry time. probably June July so when you're. spreading seed in the springtime or the. summer time you need to put down. something that is heat and drought. tolerant if we put the millet down the. millet will take and it will shade the. fescue the perennial grass and the. perennial grass will take back over cool. awesome stuff guys so it did a great job. SuperDuper happy still got a lot more. work to do but look at that awesome just. groomed out beautiful guys want to thank. you a whole lot for joining me here on. the Stoney Ridge farm channel hope you. enjoyed some of this footage enjoyed the. music in the fellowship we'll see you. guys next time on the Stoney Ridge all. right. Pierce we had some way supposed to be. Stone Tyrion. Oh</p>

[Applause]. get ready for the shock of your life. still there were a few minor differences. at the end of the mega Ranger episode.

 - ASR text: and. Vasco's busy routine in. national competitions has begun.. Now the team needs to face exhausting games and. trips during the week.. For now, one of the Giant of the. Hill's strengths is to try to eliminate the opponents in the. first match of the Copa do Brasil, but. in the second round of the competition, this. mission will not be so easy. The Rio de Janeiro team. plays against Cuiabá away from. home. I think it is for us too,. Jair, to get. used to knowing that we will have. a lot of games. He will need to count on. everyone and without sleeping with full strength to. see if we can eliminate this. return game. Vasco is a big team. that needs to think big. We are going. to win first, to score a goal,. not thinking about scoring two goals right away, but. always respecting the Cuiabá team.. Who knows who it is? The difficult part comes from. good results. We are going there. to get our result. If we. can eliminate the return game, the. Colina team, the maximum for the next. game, which takes place at Arena Pantanal, can be the. nursery of the Cruz-Maltina team. It is. going through a good phase. It was the champion of the Copa. Verde of the Mato Grosso championship. The. next game deserves a. Special attention, being a champion is very. difficult and I select the champion of two. competitions in one week, right? So they. have a qualified team, Dori. I've already been. through a bit of their team. You guys, we're. going there respecting the. opponent but with the intention of winning,. which is always Vasco's objective.. Vasco will enter the field with a. very similar team. In the last match. against Goiás, the only news should be. the departure of striker Dagoberto and the. entry of midfielder Marcinho. Doriva doesn't. care if he gives the players a rest and. if necessary, he makes a point of being an. example.</p>

Shoveling is it. good there goes the rest of the. dut somebody got buzz buzz today in a. bath look at look at this oh my gosh do. a very good job okay so every. time he's got random little long hairs. pches every time we shave Ed we're like. next time he's going to the groomers. next time he's going to the groomers and. we just like time gets away we're busy. whatever and we just decide at the last. minute okay we're just going to do it. ourselves it it needs to be done and it. was bad his coat was like a Winter thick. coat and we're like it's June why does. he have this crazy thick coat Michael. had to keep going over and over and over. and even still it looks like Lamb's wool. doesn't it thick it's like really oh can. you see all the hair oh he oh he needs. to be brushed I washed him afterwards. but definitely without a shadow of a. doubt the next time he is going to the. gmers and I'm going to tell him shave. them I always I always say shave them. huh SK them SK them I always say shave. them as close as you can without making. him look dumb. but hey we can't fix that one we can't. fix dumb he's just going to look dumb. looking no matter what and you know what. were we thinking like what just repeated. it dumb dumb oh. great wonderful and what were we. thinking getting a long-haired dog so. many people ask what kind of dog Eddie. is he's a long-haired or they call it a. rough coat Jack Russell Terrier so he's. like any other Jack Russell Terrier he. just has long thick hair which we love. like the way it looks and everything but. man we have to shave it and brush it and. it's just he sheds really bad which I. think most dogs shed pretty bad. anyway good boy Ed good B can you see. the hair on the couch don't show. closeups of it well I mean oh the hair. on the couch. e ew he needs a good. brush yeah and then we need to vacuum. brush don't. you you look at his face well it used to. be that anytime we would tell him we. would always brush him before going to. the dog park and so now every time we. tell him he needs brushed he thinks. that's what's happening and it's not and. that was a habit from years ago and he. still remembers he still remembers all. over me I know oh look look at that oh. and now he's shaking your couch is like. white. now it's time for the question of the. day today's. question I have to find it again comes. from Lexi Reed 45545 plays MSP and the. question is what is your most scariest. ride you have ever been. on scariest. ride I don't know that there's. technically a ride that I've been. terrified of scared of yeah but when I. was younger I went on a ride at C to. point called mean streak and it was like. an all wooden roller coaster and it's. one of those where those are rough yeah. and you just how is this thing not going. to just fall apart right like toothpicks. so it was it's the whole thing just the. metal frame like lattice work of metal. or of a wooden frame and it just seems. like it would not stay together. that was scary I don't really care for. the wooden I've I've been on the wooden. roller coaster huge at Bush Gardens the. guazi and it was just rough it's like. really you have a headache and your back. hurts afterwards it's fun but it's. rough I don't think there's really ride. that I've been that terrified of either. I guess Tower of Terror was pretty. scary yeah that's all I can think of. okay Alex has only just started riding. the rides and stuff so that's kind of um. a tough one Manion no what Mansion the. question scariest the most scariest ride. we took her on it when we went when she. was little and she was. scared Manion yeah she didn't want to. see The Ghost and stuff did she hide her. face yeah I don't remember that's too. long ago oh this is hard for me because. all the rides are fun to me I like to be. scared. but it's not even scary it's just fun I. guess I'll go with the shikra Bush. Gardens because there's nothing above. you there's nothing below you you're. just kind of. dangling it's pretty scary I. guess I guess and it's really not that. bad it really doesn't scare me that much. so we want to know from you guys what is. the most scariest ride you have ever. been on leave it in the comments below</p>
